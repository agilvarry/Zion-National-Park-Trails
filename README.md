# Zion National Park Trails App

This is a mobile web app for displaying trails and user added points of interest in Zion National Park.

I created it for a capstone course while attending grad school at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2019.



## Dependencies

* [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) - a library for mobile-friendly interactive maps
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - jQuery
* [Carto.js](https://carto.com/developers/carto-js/v3/) - library that interacts with different CARTO APIs, which this app uses as a backend
